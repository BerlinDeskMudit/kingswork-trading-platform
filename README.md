> **Simulation notice.** KingStop is an engineering and educational project. It is **not financial
> advice** and it never executes real brokerage trades — everything happens in paper portfolios.
> Optional integrations (Yahoo Finance, Redis, Stripe, Groq) are **off by default**, so a fresh clone
> runs against SQLite and deterministic market fixtures with no external services or API keys.

## Why KingStop

Trading research is scattered across brokers, charting tools, news tickers, chat groups, and
spreadsheets. KingStop closes the loop on your own machine: every page reads from the same FastAPI
`/api/v1` surface that the signal engines, risk manager, and backtester write to — one coherent view
of the whole research-to-trade loop, and a safe place to rehearse it.

- **Self-contained.** One `python` + `npm` pair boots the whole platform against SQLite and
  deterministic market fixtures. No brokerage, exchange, or API key required.
- **Real markets, optionally.** Yahoo Finance can stream daily data for US, NSE, BSE, and crypto
  tickers; the simulated collectors keep every feature demoable offline.
- **Transparent models.** Signals show their indicators, the risk manager reports position sizing,
  value-at-risk, and exposure, backtests report fills, commission, PnL, and drawdown, and prediction
  markets resolve with auditable CPMM math.
- **Safe by construction.** Stop-loss / take-profit defaults, position caps, and responsible-use
  guardrails ship enabled.
- **Social by default.** Share research through portfolios, leaderboards, feeds, streaks, and daily
  challenges — without handing over your keys.
- **One API surface.** 28 domain routers under a versioned `/api/v1`, documented interactively at
  `/docs` and paired with WebSocket channels.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.11+**
- **Node.js 20+** with npm 9+
- **Docker** (optional) for the one-command full stack
- **Optional services** — Groq (`GROQ_API_KEY`), Stripe (`STRIPE_*`), and Redis (`USE_REDIS`) are
  all opt-in and ship disabled.

## Quick start

### 1. Start the API

```bash
git clone https://github.com/0xMudit/kingswork-trading-platform.git
cd kingswork-trading-platform/backend
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate        # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

The API is available at <http://localhost:8000>, with interactive OpenAPI docs at
<http://localhost:8000/docs>.

### 2. Start the frontend

In a second terminal:

```bash
cd kingswork-trading-platform/frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open <http://localhost:5173/kingswork/>. The Vite dev server proxies `/api` and `/ws` to the local
FastAPI server. The dev database seeds demo users and sample trading data — override all demo and
test account values in `backend/.env` for any shared deployment.

### Docker

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Starts the API on port `8000` and the frontend on port `5173`. Review the compose environment and
reverse-proxy settings before production use.

## Configuration

Copy `backend/.env.example` to `backend/.env`. The app works locally with SQLite and simulated
market data; external service keys are optional. Configuration is read through `backend/config.py`.

| Group | Important variables |
| --- | --- |
| Core | `DATABASE_URL` · `SECRET_KEY` · `DEBUG` · `API_PREFIX` |
| Market data | `USE_LIVE_MARKET_DATA` · `YAHOO_REFRESH_INTERVAL` · `MARKET_DATA_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` |
| AI chat | `GROQ_API_KEY` · `GROQ_MODEL` · `GROQ_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` |
| Cache | `USE_REDIS` · `REDIS_URL` |
| Billing | `STRIPE_ENABLED` · `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` · `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` · `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` |
| Risk defaults | `MAX_POSITION_SIZE_PCT` · `MAX_PORTFOLIO_RISK_PCT` · `STOP_LOSS_PCT` |

Never commit `backend/.env`, databases, logs, or production credentials — all excluded by
`.gitignore`.

```

The frontend is a React SPA whose dashboard sections are URL-driven at `/dashboard/:section` and
lazy-loaded; every page talks to the same `/api/v1` surface through a typed Axios client that
attaches the JWT bearer token. On the backend, `main.py` registers 28 domain routers plus a
WebSocket channel, and each domain delegates to a shared engine layer: `signals/` computes technical
indicators and an ML model, `risk/manager.py` does position sizing, risk scoring, and value-at-risk,
`backtesting/engine.py` models fills, commission, PnL, and drawdown, and `fusion/engine.py` combines
signals into the intelligence stack. SQLAlchemy models persist to SQLite by default, with Redis,
Yahoo Finance, Stripe, and Groq all gated behind environment flags. See
[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for routing, state ownership, and extension guidance.

## Commands

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `uvicorn main:app --reload` | Run the API from `backend/` on port 8000. |
| `npm run dev` | Run the Vite dev server from `frontend/` on port 5173. |
| `npm run typecheck` | Type-check the frontend with `tsc --noEmit`. |
| `npm test` | Run the frontend Vitest suite. |
| `npm run build` | Production frontend build. |
| `python -m pytest` | Run the backend test suite from `backend/`. |
| `docker compose up --build` | Boot the full stack (API + frontend). |

The backend suite covers the risk manager (position sizing, risk scoring, value-at-risk) and the
backtest engine (fills, commission, PnL, drawdown). CI runs both suites plus the frontend typecheck,
tests, and build on Node 22 and Python 3.12 for every push and pull request.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| Markets look static or "fake" | `USE_LIVE_MARKET_DATA` is `false` by default — that is the simulated-fixture mode. Set it to `true` for Yahoo Finance data (needs network access). |
| AI chat returns an error | The Groq assistant is opt-in. Set `GROQ_API_KEY` (and optionally `GROQ_MODEL`) in `backend/.env` and restart the API. |
| Frontend calls fail or 401 loops | Confirm the API is running on `:8000`; Vite proxies `/api` and `/ws` to it. Sign in with seeded demo credentials or register a fresh account. |
| Redis or Stripe errors on boot | Both are opt-in. Leave `USE_REDIS=false` and `STRIPE_ENABLED=false`, or provide the matching keys. |
| `source .venv/bin/activate` fails on Windows | Use `.venv\Scripts\activate` in PowerShell instead. |
| Database state looks stale | The dev database is seeded on first boot; delete the local SQLite file to re-seed. |

## Roadmap

The [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) tracks proposed future work beyond the current implementation. Items are
drafts pending owner confirmation, but the shape of it:

- **Phase 1** — pluggable broker adapters and real order execution (paper stays the default).
- **Phase 2** — additional market-data providers and intraday WebSocket price streaming.
- **Phase 3** — an open, trainable ML signal layer with a feature store and model registry.
- **Phase 4** — realtime social feeds, comments, reactions, and moderation tooling.
- **Phase 5** — Progressive Web App, responsive audit, and accessibility passes.
- **Phase 6** — Kubernetes manifests, Prometheus/Grafana, tracing, and load testing.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome — issues, docs, and pull requests alike. Start with
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for setup, code style, and the reviewable-PR bar, and
[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for where the code lives. Roadmap work is tracked in
[ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md). Please read the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md); it applies to every
project space.

Good first issues are labelled
[`good first issue`](https://github.com/0xMudit/kingswork-trading-platform/labels/good%20first%20issue).

## Security

KingStop is a paper-trading and research platform and must never be connected to a real brokerage.
Keys and credentials (`STRIPE_*`, `GROQ_API_KEY`, `SECRET_KEY`) must remain environment variables —
never commit `backend/.env`, databases, logs, or production secrets. Report vulnerabilities privately
per [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) rather than in a public issue.
